## Do This BEFORE You Get Started

> **Set up these accounts first - you'll need them to run the app!**

### Step 1: Get Clerk (Authentication)

Clerk handles all your authentication - sign up, sign in, protected routes, and user management. It's incredibly easy to set up and saves you weeks of work.

[**Sign up for Clerk**](https://go.clerk.com/aV0wpm7) - Free tier available

### Step 2: Get Expo & EAS (Development Builds)

Expo is how we build and deploy React Native apps. You'll need an Expo account to create development builds and submit to app stores.

[**Sign up for Expo**](https://expo.dev/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=sonny&utm_campaign=35663643-SDK%2055&utm_content=home) - Free tier available

### Also Required (Standard Links)

You'll also need accounts for these services:

- **Convex** (Real-time backend) - [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
- **OpenAI** (AI embeddings & chat) - [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)

## What Is This App?

Think of Heartly as a **Tinder-style dating app with an AI matchmaker built in**. Instead of random swiping, the app uses OpenAI embeddings to find people with similar interests and personalities.

### Key Concepts Explained

| Concept | Simple Explanation |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Vector Embeddings** | Your profile (bio + interests) gets converted into a list of 1,536 numbers. People with similar numbers = similar personalities! |
| **Real-time Subscriptions** | When someone messages you, it appears instantly - no refresh needed. Convex handles this automatically. |
| **Compatibility Scoring** | The AI compares your "number list" with others and ranks them by similarity. Higher score = better match! |

### What You Can Build With These Patterns

- Dating & social apps
- AI-powered recommendation systems
- Real-time chat applications
- Any app that matches users by interests/preferences

## How It Works

### User Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Sign Up] --> B[Onboarding]
    B --> C[Discover]
    C --> D[Match]
    D --> E[Chat]
```

### AI Matching Pipeline

```mermaid

    A[User Profile] --> B[OpenAI Embedding]
    B --> C[1536-dim Vector]
    C --> D[Convex Vector Search]
    D --> E[Preference Filter]
    E --> F[Compatibility Score]
    F --> G[GPT Explanation]
```

**How it works:**
1. Your bio and interests are sent to OpenAI
2. OpenAI converts them into a 1,536-number vector
3. Convex searches for similar vectors in the database
4. Results are filtered by your preferences (age, gender, distance)
5. GPT generates a human-readable explanation of compatibility

### Real-time Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Expo App] <-->|Subscriptions| B[Convex Backend]
    B --> C[(Database)]
    B --> D[OpenAI API]
    C --> E[Vector Index]
```

**Key insight:** Convex subscriptions mean your UI automatically updates when data changes - no polling, no manual refreshes!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm** - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **iOS Simulator** or physical iOS device
- **Clerk account** - [**Sign up for Clerk**](https://clerk.com) (handles all authentication)
- **Expo account** - [**Sign up for Expo**](https://expo.dev) (required for dev builds)
- **Convex account** - [Sign up](https://convex.dev)
- **OpenAI API key** - [Get one](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bekidink/AI-Dating-App-Expo-React-Native.git
cd AI-Dating-App-Expo-SDK-55-Clerk-Convex-OpenAI
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

#### 4. Configure Clerk

> Don't have Clerk yet? [**Sign up here**](https://go.clerk.com/aV0wpm7) - it's free to start!

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your **Publishable Key**
4. Add it to `.env.local`:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
```

#### 5. Set Up Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Log you into Convex (if needed)
- Create a new project
- Give you a deployment URL

Add the URL to `.env.local`:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
```

#### 6. Add OpenAI API Key

> **Important:** The OpenAI key goes in Convex Dashboard, NOT in your `.env.local` file!

1. Go to [Convex Dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Settings > Environment Variables**
4. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-xxxxx`

#### 7. Create Development Build

> Don't have an Expo account? [**Sign up here**](https://expo.dev/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=sonny&utm_campaign=35663643-SDK%2055&utm_content=home) - required for EAS builds!

```bash
npx eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

Install the build on your device via Expo Orbit or QR code.

#### 8. Seed Demo Profiles

In the Convex Dashboard, go to **Functions** tab and run:

```
seed:seedDemoProfiles
```

This creates 10 sample profiles for testing.

#### 9. Run the App

```bash
pnpm start
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# ===================================
# CLIENT-SIDE (Expo)
# ===================================

# Clerk Authentication (Required)
# Get this from: https://dashboard.clerk.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx

# Convex Backend (Required)
# Run `npx convex dev` to get this URL
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud

# ===================================
# SERVER-SIDE (Convex Dashboard)
# These are set in Convex Dashboard, NOT here!
# ===================================
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx
# Set at: https://dashboard.convex.dev > Settings > Environment Variables
```

> **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file! It's already in `.gitignore`.

> **Tip:** Variables prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the client. Backend-only secrets (like `OPENAI_API_KEY`) should be set in Convex Dashboard instead.

## Database Schema

The app uses 5 tables in Convex. See [`convex/schema.ts`](convex/schema.ts) for the full schema.

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **users** | User profiles | `name`, `bio`, `interests`, `photos`, `embedding` (1536-dim vector), `location`, `ageRange`, `lookingFor` |
| **matches** | Mutual likes | `user1Id`, `user2Id`, `matchedAt`, `aiExplanation` |
| **swipes** | Like/reject actions | `swiperId`, `swipedId`, `action`, `createdAt` |
| **messages** | Chat messages | `matchId`, `senderId`, `content`, `read` |
| **dailyPicks** | AI-curated picks | `userId`, `picks[]` (with scores & explanations), `expiresAt` |

### Key Indexes

- **Vector Index:** `users.by_embedding` - 1536 dimensions for similarity search
- **Swipe Lookups:** `swipes.by_swiper_and_swiped` - Fast duplicate checking
- **Match Queries:** Bidirectional indexes on `user1Id` and `user2Id`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Development

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Metro bundler won't start** | Run `pnpm start --clear` to clear cache |
| **Dev client crashes on launch** | Rebuild with `npx eas build --profile development --platform ios` |
| **Changes not reflecting** | Restart Convex with `npx convex dev` |

### Authentication

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"Invalid token" errors** | Check your Clerk Publishable Key is correct |
| **Can't sign in** | Ensure Clerk app has email/password enabled |
| **Protected routes not working** | Verify `ClerkProvider` wraps your app in `_layout.tsx` |

### Database

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **No profiles showing** | Run `seed:seedDemoProfiles` in Convex Dashboard |
| **Vector search returns empty** | Ensure user has `embedding` field (run onboarding) |
| **Real-time not updating** | Check Convex connection in browser devtools |

### AI

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **"OpenAI API key invalid"** | Verify key in Convex Dashboard (Settings > Environment Variables) |
